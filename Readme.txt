1- ProductRecommendedSystem.ipynb is having code about recommneded system creation. Here I have user based and item based recommendation where the error were
   less in item based so item based system is used for recommendation. In this file also, I have included the sentiment analysis for top 5 product recommendation.
2- SentimentAnalysis.ipynb is having code for sentiment analysis. Here I have used Logistic regression, naivebyes with multinomial and bernouli both, and xgboost etc.
   logistic regression performence was better that others, s logistic regression model is used for predict the sentiment.
3- Recommendprod_flask folder have the files, deployed to the flask and Heroku.
4- itembasedrecommendedsys.pkl is for recommendation system.
5- lgregression.pkl for logistic regression model.
6- tfidf.pkl is for tfidf vectorizer reference.
7- The deployed app is taking username as input and returning top 5 recommended product for that user (It takes a few seconds to show the recommendation).
